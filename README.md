# DadJokes App
Navigate to DadJokes folder to explore project files

  - **Project Summary** - XMLHttpRequest used to make request to API. DadJokes uses [DadJokes API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/), call to this API will return JSON object, provided 'Header Accept = application/json'. The JSON object will have jokes in it, extract and display the jokes. Initially, 10 unique jokes will be generated by making 10 or more requests, the reason for making more than 10 requests is to get 10 unique jokes. The 10 jokes will be stored locally, to clear the jokes from local storage, click the 'Clear Jokes' button. For more jokes, you can use 'New Jokes' button. You can also 'upvote' or 'downvote' a joke using 'up-arrow' or 'down-arrow' respectively.

# Random Card Generator
Navigate to CardPicker folder to explore project files

  - **Project Summary** - Fetch API used to make request to API. Random Card Generator will pick a random card from deck of cards. I used an [Deckofcards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) to achieve this. Call to this 'https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/shuffle/' API returns a JSON object which has 'deck_id' property. Use that 'deck_id' to make another request to this url'https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/${deck_id}/draw/', which will draw a random card from the deck. The special feature about using this API is that it draws card from the same deck, once the deck is over - you can't able to draw cards from the deck.
